Your first 2 weeks at Commit will fly by, believe us! The main emphasis in your first 2 weeks is matching you with Startup Partners (SPs), helping you with any interview nerves, and getting you working on your [Hackathon Onboarding Project (HOP)](/eps/ep-hop).

![EP First 2 Weeks](./epfirst2weeks-image.png)

To make sure nothing gets overlooked we have members of our Engineer Success Team there to support you. They will set up a private "EPX-[EP NAME]" channel on Slack so you will be able to ask any questions from Day 1. 

To go along with their support, we have created an onboarding checklist for you with daily prompts. 


# Day 1 (Part 1) - Admin Stuff

We are so excited you are here! These checklist items will be your main tasks for the next 7 days as you get acquainted with all things Commit.

Our primary point of contact is Slack so the Engineer Success team will be messaging you there in a specific channel made just for you (your EPX channel)!

If you have any questions at all during your onboarding, you can direct them there.

**Expectations**:

During your first week at Commit, your focus is on your [HOP Demo](https://docs.commit.dev/eps/ep-hop) and interviewing with Startup Partners (we call them SPs) to start your 3 month pilot. 
You'll present your HOP Demo next Thursday (Day 7 of your Onboarding) to other EPs, graduates (we call them GPs) and interested community members! 
We've got a few of the most recent ones [recorded](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQRTWrxEpL0SpjyzuIcvePs1LKyTP7pI3) for you to get an idea of what to expect when presenting your demo, and hopefully get you excited!

Other expectations after your HOP Demo include:

 -   Internal contributions
	- We will help you get started with those after your HOP Demo!
    
 -   Work on a blog post
	- The Engineer Success and Content teams will help you with this!
    
 -   Sharpen your development skills by taking a MOOC (massive open online course). If you choose this route, it's expected you'll work out loud and share your learning through blog and/or LinkedIn posts
