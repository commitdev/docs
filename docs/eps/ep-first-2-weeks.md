Your first 2 weeks at Commit will fly by, believe us! The main emphasis in your first 2 weeks is matching you with Startup Partners (SPs), helping you with any interview nerves, and getting you working on your [Hackathon Onboarding Project (HOP)](/eps/ep-hop).

To make sure nothing gets overlooked we have members of our Engineer Success Team there to support you. They will set up a private "EPX-[EP NAME]" channel on Slack so you will be able to ask any questions from Day 1. 

To go along with their support, we have created an onboarding checklist for you with daily prompts. You will be able to view this checklist after activating your Humi profile - [Humi](https://hr.humi.ca) is Commit's HRIS (Human Resources Information System).

Here is a quick overview of what to expect from the checklist, but please spend some time carefully reviewing the in-depth checklist in HUMI.
