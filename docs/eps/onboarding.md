# Onboarding

1. From day 1 to your HOP Demo, go through [the checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dxoh2oAhdQcSoLtJyEj2ovm9wUlwMLjnUYncso-vSMw/edit#gid=0) with your EPX Coordinator
2. After your HOP Demo, your EPX Coordinator will navigate you to this guide through your EPX channel

## Post onboarding/pre-pilot

Once you've completed your HOP Demo, your EPX coordinator will ask you to:

1. Set up a project board
2. Contribute to a project until your Pilot starts
3. Clean up your project boards before you offboard

### **1. Setup your project board**

- Decide on what you want to work on:
  - Another HOP, continue the HOP project
  - Create a blog article for "Code + Tell" -- teach someone something in 5-10 minutes and it'll be posted as an article on `commit.dev/blog`
  - [Platform](https://github.com/commitdev/helix#platform-wiki) (An internal Commit sponsored application used to help match engineers with startups)
- Create a Github Project Board (see this [example how-to recording](https://github.com/commitdev/epcg#:~:text=example%20how-to%20recording))
  - Use your first AND last name (ie. Simon Ho) to as the name of your project board
  - Pull in your first issue to work on from the chosen project
  - Assign yourself the issue
  - **Send the link to your project board to your EPX Channel**

- Start coding/problem solving!
  - Try to work on one issue at a time, moving issues from "To Do" to "In Progress" to "Done"
  - You will be responsible for keeping your project board up-to-date at all times

### **2. Contribute to a project until your Pilot starts**

- When you finish the initial ticket, pick up 3 more and so on until your Pilot starts
- Join the [Daily Standup](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/82469142067?pwd=cWcvU0lrMFNXeitCbUNybGlPVnZDQT09) to update the Cohort on your progress and experience
  - 10AM PST everyday for 15 minutes during the Post onboarding/pre-pilot period
  - At the meeting, the Scrum Master will go through everyone's project board(s) and ask:
    - What did you do yesterday?
    - What will you do today?
    - Any blockers?
  - As part of picking up tickets, we'd also like you to write a short technical blog post about the work you're doing in keeping with our commitment to Working Out Loud (WOL)
    - Work with Simon to identify a relevant topic
    - Log it in the Blog Proposals [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ed4-RVeMUNDDJZvfK7eArJDHjIgl62HuH83b4jK-_Qc/edit) and follow the instructions there

### **3. Clean up you project boards before you offboard**

- Clean up your project board(s)
  - Finish up any issues you have left "In Progress" and move them to "Done"
  - Move any leftover "To Do" items back to the project's backlog
- In your last Daily Standup, let your Scrum Master know your plans for any leftover items on your project boards
  - Will all tickets be completed by EOD?
  - What are your plans to finish these tickets?
  - Are there any tickets you will work on during first week of Pilot?
- Publish your technical blog post (or set a plan to get it published) before your last day
- Notify the Scrum Master at the end of your last day when you are ready to confirm everything has been left in good shape

> You will be responsible for any "unfinished" issues. Please figure out a plan to complete what you've started before your Pilot start date or finish it within your first week on the Pilot

That's it! Feel free to ping your EPX Coordinator if you need help with anything else.
