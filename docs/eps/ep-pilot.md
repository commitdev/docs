## Overview

You’ve recieved a verbal pilot offer from an SP you’re excited to work with, congratulations!  Now let’s share with you a quick overview of the next steps.

- A member of our Engineer Success team will work with you and the SP to find a start date that aligns with you both.
- The Engineer Success team will send off paperwork to the SP for them to review and sign. One things are signed, the Engineer Success team will notify you.
- An onboarding/welcome email should come from your SP within 12-48 hours of official paperwork being signed. When you receive the email, please ensure that you respond to them in a timely manner. Didn't receive an email? Reach out to the SP directly, and let us know so we can work with them on communication expectations.

## EP Expectations While on a Pilot

### Check-ins

At the 1-week, 1-month, and 2-month marks of your pilot, the Engineer Success team will be checking in with you in your EPX Slack channel to see how you are doing. Particularly, we will be asking you what’s been going well and what has not been working well. Please be as honest with us as possible in these check-in conversations so we can help you.

### Communication

Please keep in touch with us during your pilot! We would greatly appreciate it if you respond to our communication with you within 48 hours to ensure we are best supporting you and prioritizing your success. Don't worry, we won't bombard you with messages!
 
### Your Best Effort and Ours too

Sometimes a pilot doesn’t go as you expected and there are issues that need resolving. Our commitment to you is that we will work with you and the SP to resolve any issues so that the pilot can continue. In general, EPs only leave a pilot under rare circumstances.
 
When you join a pilot, it is expected that you stay for the full 3 months. 

*Note:* If you’re feeling burnt out and feel this may affect you completing your pilot, have a look at the [Resources section](#resources) at the bottom of this document for support, and reach out in your EPX Slack channel for support. Remember, our main goal is to help you feel welcome, safe, and supported! 
 
### Decide

At the 2-month mark, we'll check in with you about whether you wish to stay with the SP after your pilot, or return to matchmaking. This check in should prompt you to  book a 1:1 meeting with your manager to discuss next steps with your pilot. *Please coordinate with your manager to confirm next steps by the 2.5-month mark (2 weeks before your pilot end date) so we can best support you.* 

Topics to discuss in your 1:1 meeting will vary depending on your decision, but include:


- The status of next steps for your pilot (continuing on full-time, extending the pilot, or offboarding)
- The company’s offboarding process (if you choose not to continue)
- Initial salary negotiations

We can support you with your decision making process! Reach out to the Engineer Success team in your EPX Slack channel. 

## How does vacation work on a pilot?
We want to help you balance between (1) maximizing your time working with and getting to know your pilot SP and (2) ensuring that you take time to rest and recharge even while on pilot. For this reason, SPs are advised that EPs can take 3 days off during their pilot. We advise you to provide as much notice as possible to the SP about your time-off plans and communicate these plans to the Engineer Success team as well. Please log your time off in our HRIS, [Humi](https://www.humi.ca/), as well as your SPs HRIS (if they have one). 

Ideally, Commit, the SP, and the EP will all try to align on a time-off plan that is acceptable to all parties. If you have vacation planned that is longer than 3 days, let the Engineer Success team know so we can help you navigate this request!

## How do I decide if I want to join a start-up full-time after my pilot?

There are 5 key factors you might consider when deciding to join an SP full-time after your pilot. You might not say yes to all of these things! What’s most important is that you feel confidence that spending the next chapter of your professional career at this company will bring you enjoyment and/or purpose.

It feels simple, but asking yourself “what decision am I most likely to regret?" can sometimes be the re-framing you need to make a decision!

### Accomplishment:

What noteworthy project(s) have I worked on in these last three months? 

### Impact:

Would I write a line in my resume about the work I have done over these three months? Would I value this specific work experience if I was hiring for my own company?

### Growth/Future Alignment:

Have I acquired valuable insights or skills? Are these skills aligned with my future goals?

### Challenge:

Have there been days when I was thinking about a work problem in the shower so profoundly that I forgot if I used the soap or not?

### Community:

Am I excited and happy to go to work every morning and see my teammates? Do I believe in the mission, vision, and leadership of this team or company? 

## Returning to Commit after a Pilot

As a pilot comes to a close, you may not continue on with that SP full-time. We are here to support you with that choice and next steps!

### Offboarding checklist

Here is a general guide on how to offboard at your SP.
 
#### Things to think about 

While you finish your pilot, this is a great time to think about the hard and soft skills that you want to take away from your time at this organization, write LinkedIn recommendations for your colleagues, and try and leave the onboarding experience for engineers better than you found it. Often we learn best through identifying what we don’t like about a product, a culture, a technology, etc. Take some time to articulate those, as they can be helpful directional guides for you.
 
#### Offboarding Tasks 
 
Before you last day at your pilot, we would recommend you consider and complete the following action-items as you off-board at your SP in the next few weeks:
- Schedule an exit interview
- In the interview, create a handoff plan for a smooth transition
- Document everything that you do
- Break down your daily/weekly tasks into step-by-step instructions
- Transfer ownership of any login information that might be important
- Take note of any recurring tasks, meetings or reminders you played a key role in (daily, monthly, weekly, quarterly)
- Take note of any priorities for the upcoming sprint(s) that you didn’t get to
- Designate a key point of contact with whom your "Out of Office" email will point people towards, and can field internal questions to. Ensure that they have context on the questions they might receive.
- Provide them your information to contact you in a true emergency
- If there’s anyone you’d like to stay in touch with, get their contact information
- Ask for and offer references and recommendations on LinkedIn

### Return to Matchmaking

1. Update your profile on the Commit platform to represent any changes over your last pilot
- Add to the "Technical skills & Specializations" section any new tech stack you got exposure to
- "Company Preferences" may have changed
- "Goals" may have changed
- New "Work Experience" section can be completed

2. Find a new contribution 
- Work on another HOP
- Work on a blog post about your pilot or other topic of choice
- Work on an open source project of your choosing
- Work on a MOOC (massive open online course) of your choosing (Udemy, Coursera, etc)

3. Keep us in the loop

- Respond to communication from us and SPs within 1 business day. 
- Connect with other EPs to learn about what they're working on (you’ll be added to a daily check in channel on Slack)!
- Reflect on what you’re looking for next and share with the Engineer Success team in your EPX Slack channel
- What skills do you want to build in your next pilot?
- What type of problems do you want to solve?
- What didn’t work at your last pilot(s) that you want to avoid in the future?
- What went well that you want to replicate?
