# Hackathon Onboarding Project (HOP)

## Overview

As part of your first few weeks at Commit, we want to allow space for you to get excited about coding and start to contribute to the Commit community.

### What's the benefit of a HOP?

-   We believe this will help you get to know the team, practice some coding skills, and help us build a better experience for everyone at Commit.
    
-   You may not have had the time, autonomy, or supportive community to start a project you're interested in. Your HOP gives you the space to do that!
    
-   You will demo your HOP the Thursday after your start date. This is a great opportunity for you to get feedback from your peers in a supportive environment, and test the waters with presenting a technical idea in a safe space.
    

If you have any questions, get in touch with us in your EPX Slack Channel. Your Onboarding Partner (OP) has also completed a HOP so they are a great person to ask any questions!

## Timeline and Expectations

You begin your HOP on Day 2 (Thursday) of your onboarding and demo your HOP on the following Thursday.

Your demo will be no more than 10 minutes and should provide details about:

-   Why this project in particular (out of the endless options in the world!)
    
-   Why you chose the tech stack you did to complete the project
    
-   Stretch goals/next steps
    
-   A demo of the project - we want to see how it works :) We really look forward to your demo!
    

:::note
This is a learning exercise, not something that needs to be fully completed in the timeline. If you‚Äôve worked on something, please demo it even if it‚Äôs not finished or polished! Sharing is caring.
:::


Share your HOP with our community by uploading it to your projects section and providing daily updates. We recognize this can be a heavy lift, but we are passionate about this for a few reasons:

-   This allows us the Commit Success Team visibility into your progress so we can support with unblocking you
    
-   This allows greater community collaboration and knowledge sharing
    
-   This helps Commit understand if your work qualifies for specific grants (which you can learn more about below!).
    

  

## Suggested Project Demo Approach

Ideally, we want to see your HOP Demo as an iterative learning process. We hope to hear you tell the story of how the implementation went (at the coding level, not the design or architecture level).

Our community loves learning from other developers and ultimately wants to see:

-   your overall learnings
    
-   how you were challenged
    
-   how you overcame those challenges.
    

When presenting your HOP Demo, consider taking the following approach:

**‚ÄúFirst I implemented SOLUTION 1, but that resulted in TECH ISSUE 1. As a way to solve that, I tried SOLUTION 2, but that resulted in TECH ISSUE 2. Ultimately, the iteration I landed on was SOLUTION 3, which I realize now isn‚Äôt a perfect solution because of TECH ISSUE 3, but it resolves the most issues for now.‚Äù**

  

## Ideas

### Past projects

We have [a comprehensive list of past project pitches](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1xPY1nQUeTTlN_lfIDQwrYVde4zQx8_vf) for you to review. 

You can also view [a video playlist of some recent HOP Demos!](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQRTWrxEpL0RJ281ZujVtGCEkDR7NLkmu)

## Sharing

HOP Demos are recorded and may be shared by our Content team on various social platforms, such as LinkedIn. If you'd prefer for your HOP Demo to not be recorded and shared, please let the Engineer Success team know!

## Commit Grants

Commit prides itself in being resourceful so we can provide our developers with the best resources. One of the resources we work with is SR&ED!

Commit claims SR&ED on all eligible work, which includes HOPs that qualify. The best way we can determine if a HOP qualifies is through consistent daily updates. We work with a wonderful consultant who may reach out to you after your demo for additional information as needed. This helps us financially and we appreciate your support with this initiative!

  
## SR&ED Fast Facts

-   Pronounced like ‚Äòshred‚Äô üßÄ
    
-   Refers to investment tax credits available under the Scientific Research and Experimental Development Program offered by the Government of Canada
    
-   Eligible businesses (like Commit!) can claim SR&ED credits on their income tax return for eligible work done that year
    
-   We claim SR&ED for our own developers, EPs not yet placed on pilots working on their HOPs, and EPs on pilots with US startups
