Commit is officially an Invite-only network of software developers! 

This is important for us to maintain the validity of our pre-vetted network and to ensure our community members 

are the ones who get to do the inviting. 

Recommendations are the life-blood of Commit. They ensure that we can continue to grow our community while keeping the talent-level high.

If being part of the Commit community has benefited you, think about who else in your network it could help. 

Whenever you are ready to invite someone you can log into out app, and fill out the Recommend button in the top nav bar.

Thank you for your support!
