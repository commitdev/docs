Here are some critical things for you to know as a Commit Startup Partner (SP):

### Our Commitment to the Program

-   Commit App - As a SP, you will gain access to our app to connect with the best developers - grow your team whenever you want, wherever you want!
    
-   Peer Support - We provide you with peer to peer support through constant communication within our community.
    
-   Talent Solutions - Our goal is to match you with a developer as soon as possible. The Talent Solutions team will support you in making the best possible matches!
    

### Communication, Participation and Collaboration are Key

-   Career Long Relationship - As a hiring manager, our partnership is with you. Even if you change jobs, we are dedicated to supporting your journey as a startup leader and executive.
    
-   Stay in Touch - Making it easy for you to get quick access to candidates and give us feedback is key. We primarily work off of a dedicated Slack channel to make sure that we’re always accessible to you.
    
-   Timely & Responsive - Our goal is to respond to your inquiries within 24 business hours, and we hope you do the same! We understand times can get busy, which is why we use Slack as our communication hub to make your experience with us a seamless and easy one.
    

### Expectations During Onboarding

-   Distributed by Design - Commit is a remote-first organization. As such, our startups must be remote or hybrid only. For our hybrid startups, we expect Commit’s remote developers to be core contributors to the team.
    
-   Salary Bands - Our developers are pegged against the best of the best tech talent. As such, we expect our SPs to adhere to the average industry salary bands.
    
-   Ability to Hire - Currently we are working with developers based in Canada and the United States. However, as a remote-first organization we will become more location-agnostic in the future. Please let us know if you are unable to hire from countries outside of your organization's geographic location from the get-go.
    

### Expectations During Interviews

-   Better Interview Process - We encourage you to check out the candidates’ Record of Work (RoW) on the Commit app. With the information available from candidates' profiles on the Commit app along with the [pre-vetting process](https://https://docs.commit.dev/forstartups/sp-tech-interview) by the Commit technical community, you'll be able to skip technical rounds and instead focus on value alignment and company fit.
    
-   Rapid Feedback - After every interview, we ask for a brief retrospective (stop/start/continue) to ensure we can give feedback to the developers to help them continue to grow.
