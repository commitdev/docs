## Commit is built by Engineers, for Engineers

### Beier Cai, CTO

👋 I'm Beier, CTO and co-founder at Commit.

I’ve been a software engineer for 15 years. I’ve spent my career working at startups - I was the first engineer at Hootsuite and scaled that team to over 1000 engineers.

As my job shifted to management, I learned that I'm really passionate about helping engineers learn and grow.

I built Commit to fix the career gap that I faced as a Startup Engineer.
