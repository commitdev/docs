At Commit, we call our permanent staff the “Support Team”, as in we're the team that supports our Engineering Partners. 

We are small but mighty, with over 30 individuals located throughout Canada and USA, supporting Engineering Partners living in North America, Brazil, and Mexico. 

Every employee of Commit has a passion for learning, helping, and definitely likes to have fun - our company ethos. We love collaborating to support software engineers! 

## Diversity, inclusion, equity, and belonging at Commit

As an early-stage startup, we know it’s critical to build inclusive processes as a part of our foundation. We are committed to building and fostering an environment where our employees feel included, valued, and heard. 

As of March 2022, 40% of our Support Team identified as women with three people on our leadership team (VPs and up) identifying as women, and 50% of our Support Team identified as visible minorities with three of our leaders identifying as visible minorities. 

We know we must stay committed to equality in these numbers, including and especially on our leadership team. We also know that it doesn’t start or stop at gender or racial identity and intersects through many others.
