We are an employee-centric company and we believe that the future of work is asynchronous. In order to achieve an efficient asynchronous working culture, it's important to us that all our people stay connected and are efficient and productive with their work. We place an emphasis on Working Out Loud (WOL) and being open in async and synchronous communication channels. 
 
The following 7 guidelines help us stick to the WOL, employee-centric mandate. 

1. **Assume Positive Intent.** Always begin with a position of positivity, empathy, and grace.
2. **Work Out Loud (WOL).** Commit is still in the scrappy phase of a startup. We value all your thoughts, opinions, and feelings on all subject matter! Since we live in different locations and often have very different perspectives, we encourage you to work-out-loud and start conversations in [Slack channels](https://docs.commit.dev/contribute/slack) or message someone on the Support Team! 
3. **Practice Kindness.** Although you likely have not met the person you are speaking to, remember that even though you are looking at a screen, you are really talking to a person. If the message that you are sending is something you wouldn't say to a person's face, then don't send that message. 
4. **Own It.** If you say it or type it, own it. If it hurts the company or an individual, even unintentionally, we encourage you to look at things from other viewpoints and apologize without hesitation.
5. **Be a Role Model** of our [Key Operating Principle](https://docs.commit.dev/about/key-operating-principle).
6. **Feedback is Key.** Given we are a remote-first team with members in various time zones and working environments, we encourage team members to give feedback and receive feedback in a considerate way.
7. **Always Adhere** to our [Community Guidelines](https://docs.commit.dev/about/code-of-conduct#community-guidelines). Everyone should be feeling welcome, safe, and supported here at Commit!
