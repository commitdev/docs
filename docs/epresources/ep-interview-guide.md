Congratulations! You have accepted an SPs interview request and have scheduled an interview.
In this article, you will find a general overview of SP interviews, what you can expect, and some tips on preparing for your interview.

## What You Can Expect

For all of our Career Transitions programs, we encourage SPs to conduct 1-2 interviews total. The focus is to get to know the developer's skillset and experiences and ensure a good fit for the startup.  

You can see a complete summary of what we communicate with SPs [in Commit's Guide to Interviewing Commit Engineers](https://docs.commit.dev/sps/commit-interviews).

:::note
For developers in Commit's EP Program only, we share that Commit EPs do not expect a technical component in their interviews and are not actively going through technical interviews at other organizations. If you are in the EP program and are asked to complete a take-home coding assignment or do a technical interview, **it is up to you whether you would like to proceed or not**.

## Before The Interview

### Familiarize Yourself With the Following:

**SP Website**

- Familiarize yourself with their product and who their customers are.
- Have you built or worked on a similar product? Do you understand their competitors and the competitive landscape of the SP? 
  - You will want to be able to speak to this, so prepare stories to share of your interactions with and experience with their product type, and their product market.
- If you don’t have any related or relevant experience with their specific product, this is common!
  - You can speak to your specific interest with their product/market. Some things to think about include: Why do you find this an interesting industry? How will working in this industry/role help you achieve some of your professional goals? 
  
**SP Profile on the Platform**

- Who is going to be on the call? Do you know anyone in common? What do you know about them? 
- Take notes of anything you find on their profile that is interesting or relevant to your experience. 
 
**SP Tech Stack**

- Do you have experience in that tech stack? If so, what projects have you worked on related to that tech stack and what role did you play? What were the results?
- You will want to be prepared to share specific examples of how you have used/interacted with their tech stack.  
- If you have minimal experience with their tech stack, be prepared to share examples of how you have learned technical skills quickly, as they will be looking to understand how quickly you can ramp up. 
 
**Your Platform Profile and Resume**

- Do you have any previous work experience that would relate to the roles and responsibilities of this SP position? These can be transferable skills such as prior product management experience, leadership skills, building an MVP, etc. 

### Prepare for Potential Questions

**Identify Your Skills**

- You can think of skills in 2 primary categories - technical and non technical
  - Technical skills - What are the most commonly used languages, frameworks, databases etc you have been using on a regular basis for the past few years?
  - Non-technical skills - SPs typically look for the following:
  - Communication (verbal and written)
  - Teamwork
  - Problem solving
  - Attention to detail
  - Leadership (delegation, and mentorship) 
  - Adaptability 

**Reframe Your Knowledge and Experience Gaps**

- Always make sure to talk about your gaps (weaknesses) in a positive light. Discuss what you are doing to improve your skills, and what resources you can leverage within the Commit community such as our [Discussions](https://app.commit.dev/discussions) and [Projects](https://app.commit.dev/projects) platforms. 

**Ensure You Provide a Comprehensive Answer**

One helpful way to frame these questions is by using the [STAR method](https://careerkarma.com/blog/star-interview-method/). STAR is an acronym which stands for Situation, Task, Action, Result. By using this acronym as a framework for storytelling, this can help ensure you are providing enough detail with your answers.

**Sample Question: Tell me about a time when you worked with a difficult team member.**

- **Situation** - 2 years ago, I was acting as a lead on a project where the product manager wanted full visibility of the product, more than any previous product managers I’d worked with. This was a new product manager, who was still learning our team structure and our product.  
- **Task** - The challenge was managing their high expectations, but also managing the fact we were understaffed. There were fewer developers than stages of the project, which meant it was difficult to demonstrate results, frustrating this product manager. 
- **Action** - I took the time to more critically examine the project. I determined that even though all 10 stages were needed for the MVP, we could get better progress if we made an intermediate milestone of just stage 3, 6, and 8. This would also help demonstrate the viability of the design overall.
- **Result** - After about 2 one-on-one discussions with the PM, they agreed to let us try it this way, and gave us some breathing room. We brought up 3, 6, and 8, and this showed we didn't need most of the other stages after all for an MVP.
 
**A List of Common Interview Questions for You to Practice Answering the STAR Method:**

- What is your greatest weakness?
  - Another way to reframe this question: Tell me about a time when things didn’t go as planned, and tell me how you are improving. 
- Tell me about a project that didn’t go according to plan.
- How do you handle disagreements with your team lead?
  - Bonus question: How do you handle disagreements with other teams/product stakeholders?
- What is something new that you’ve learned recently?
- Tell me about how you manage deadlines. 
- How do you handle a team member who is not acting as an equal contributor?

## During the Interview

- Arrive at your Zoom interview on time but not too early. We recommend entering your Zoom interview 2-3 minutes before your scheduled interview time. 
  - What happens if the interviewer doesn’t show up? If it’s been 5-10 minutes past the interview time and no one from the SP team has showed up, please email the SP about this matter.  
- Go in with a positive attitude, warmth, and smile. This may seem obvious, but in a virtual interview, [body language can be harder to read](https://recruitingdaily.com/how-employers-can-read-virtual-body-language-while-hiring/).  
  - SPs are not only looking for someone who can code, but a core team member who can also lead, build team culture and are excited with what they are working on. 

- Provide more than one-word answers. People want to see that you can think in detail. 
- Thank the interviewer for their time at the end of the interview.  

- Ask questions! 
  - Interviews are a 2-way conversation - you should equally be interviewing them to make sure they fit your professional goals and aspirations. 
- Remember - you’ve been selected for a reason. 
  - We’re confident you are exceptional and an asset to a startup. 
- Imagine that you are sitting beside the startup founder having coffee - this isn’t you under a microscope.

## After the Interview

- Send your interviewers a [thank you email](https://www.algrim.co/264-thank-you-email-after-interview)
  - This doesn’t have to be long: 5-8 sentences should suffice.
  - The goal is to reiterate why you’d be a good fit, and also share about why you’re excited about the opportunity
- Make some notes - what questions really threw you off? What questions do you feel you answered exceptionally well?
  - Reflecting on an interview is a key part of improvement. Interviewing is a skill and takes practice to really hone your craft. 
- After reflecting on what went well and what didn’t go as expected, feel free to share these with the Engineer Success team - we are here to help support you and help you improve your interview skills! 

If you have any questions about anything related to SP interviews, drop them in your private Slack channel or ask for a one-on-one coaching session with a member of the Engineer Success team!
