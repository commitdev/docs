## Agency Program Expectations

## Welcome to Commit!

Here are some critical things for you to know as as a developer in Commit’s Agency Program: 

- Once you start in the Agency Program, you’ll need to complete a profile on the Commit app; this needs to include your work experience and project work. Follow the program guidelines, here. You will be introduced to startup partners only once your profile is complete and reviewed by Commit’s Talent Solutions team.
- You’re expected to respond to the Talent Solutions team within 24 hours during weekdays to any communication directed at you over Slack or email during onboarding,  matchmaking, the duration of the interview process and placement discussions.
- Our communication values also extend to how you interact with our startup partners and ask you to show the same level of respect and timeliness in your communication. After all, we know how quickly startups move and make decisions, we wouldn’t want you to miss out on an opportunity by not showing urgency.

## What You Can Expect if You Don’t Communicate in a Timely Manner​

The Talent Solutions team’s role is to remove blockers and work closely with you to ensure your success in the program. This is a partnership where mutual respect and communication are essential between you and the Talent Solutions team. If we aren’t hearing from you, we won’t be able to support you. 

If you don’t respond when expected, the Talent Solutions team will be in touch with you in the following cadence:
- After 24 hours, the team will reach out via Slack and email in an effort to get in touch with you.
- After 48 hours, we’ll send you a warning email.
- After 72 hours, we’ll send you a final warning email.
- After 5 days of no communication, you will be removed as an active member of the Agency Program.

We understand that extenuating circumstances arise. If this is the case for you, it’s your responsibility to get in touch with the Talent Solutions team to inform them of the situation; this includes finding employment somewhere else. We’d discuss the next steps internally as this is handled on a case-by-case basis.
