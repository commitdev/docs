### How many Commit developers usually end up being hired after a pilot?  

Our pilot to graduation rate is 87%.  
  
Rarely have developers declined a placement after the 3-month pilot.

We’ve only experienced this in a few instances due to unforeseen circumstances. For example as a result of a change in leadership at the Startup Partner (SP) (ie. new CTO/ VP Eng brought culture and technology changes which did not align with the initial direction/promises) or changes to roadmap (ie. promised they could work on ML, which got punted to 2023).

### What is the average tenure of Commit developers after graduation?

The average tenure of Commit developers since we started in 2019 is 20 months or 1.8 years. Note that this average is weighted downward as it includes developers who have recently graduated (i.e. 4 months).

### We started placing developers with startups in 2020 with the following tenures (in months) to date.
  
|Year Placed|Tenure|% of developers placed that remain with startup |
|--|--|--|
|2020|26 months|88%|
|2021|13 months|70%|
|2022|4 months|95%|

The [industry average tenure](https://developerpitstop.com/how-long-do-software-engineers-stay-at-a-job/#:~:text=The%20national%20average%20for%20job,place%20for%20half%20as%20long.) is currently 2.1 years or 25 months.

### How long does it take to have a Commit developer start with you?

*On average, 10 business days to get matched with a Commit developer on a 3-month pilot.*  
  
However, we have matched developers with a Startup Partner (SP) in as little as 3 business days. When there is a fit between developer and startup, things happen very quickly.

### What is Commit's success rate?

On average, it takes our developers 1.2 pilots to join a company full time - they're not looking to bounce between multiple projects. As previously mentioned, 87% of our pilots transition into permanent full-time roles.

### How have our Startup Partners benefited?

  
We’ve included 3 short success stories for you to gain a better picture of the benefits of working with Commit.

You’re planning an expansion and need to hire top developer talent. What would you do?

[Plastiq’s](https://www.plastiq.com/) VP of Engineering Eric was expanding and needed to hire talented developers that could onboard quickly and contribute to the team. Eric said, “We have an extremely high bar for the engineers we hire, and all of the Commit engineers have met that bar.”

🔧 Commit addresses this urgency by reducing the total time spent on the typical hiring process from an industry average of [38 days](https://whattobecome.com/blog/interview-statistics/) to 2 days, a 95% improvement.

Eric said, “Instead of us spending most of a day interviewing a candidate through a standard approach, we’re comfortable getting to know an engineer from Commit for about an hour, to make sure we feel they’re the right fit.”  

✅ Eric hired 4 talented developers beyond their offices in San Francisco and Boston.  
  
🔎 Developer joining Eric’s team were just as happy as Eric.

“Plastiq really stood out to me because of their team. I really enjoy working with my team and with the greater Plastiq team. We have a really good set of engineers and the leadership group is really great. They’re very open, honest and direct when communicating with the company. I really enjoy working with React, and the core services and back-end are in Node. I feel confident in the work I’m doing and the impact I’m making.” - **Lilian Liang, Senior Software Engineer**

”I started a 3-month pilot project with Plastiq around the end of November. I knew within the first month that I could work there. I liked the team, I liked what we were working on, I liked my fit, in terms of being able to leverage my skill set. I felt like I could make an impact. I let my manager know that I liked it there and they got the ball rolling. Three months later I joined full-time.” - **Sim Brar, Software Architect**

You’re looking for a trusted and experienced Tech Lead to build a scalable platform. How can you determine if they have the right skills?

Non-technical founders Tarsem and James of [Planworth](https://www.planworth.co/) didn’t know how to look for or determine if a tech candidate really knew what they were talking about.  
  
Tarsem said that “what made things all the more frustrating was there were a lot of candidates we met through traditional hiring platforms who were really into our vision, but said we were too early-stage for them and that ‘once you get to 10, 15 engineers give me a call.’ “

🔧 Commit helps mitigate risk by pre-vetting candidates. Every Commit assessor has years of experience building and contributing to startups and knows how to identify high-performing well-rounded candidates.

“I tell people all the time that the Commit model and approach to implementation, execution and placement are brilliant. It just makes so much sense — you have the recruiting engine of Google, the hiring experience of veteran tech leaders and a pool of super-senior startup engineers. For us, engaging with Commit mitigated so much risk compared to doing it on our own.”

✅ We found Planworth their Tech Lead whose been with them for 3 years and was promoted to CTO.

“I liked the fact that they recognized their product-market fit. That’s something many startups don’t have from the beginning. Most startups have an idea, then they build a product, then they go out and validate it with the market. Planworth built a rough proof-of-concept and got immediate validation. So by the time I joined, it was clear they had found a market, figured out a business model, and had a plan for earning revenue. It was amazing to see. Also, it was great that I had a three-month period working with the founders and the team, before I formally joined, so I really got to know them and their product.” - **Hai Hoang, CTO**

🔎 Since then, Commit has placed more developers at Planworth.

“[Commit has] a really good community, some excellent engineers that really helped us out a few times. And there’s also support for soft skills. It’s been a while since I did it but there were public speaking courses and mentorship and that kind of stuff. It’s stuff that in early-stage, a startup may not have the resources themselves to give their developers. But if you come through Commit then you have that provided for you.…we have a good team. It’s small but we have a good range of skills, and everyone gets along really well. It’s a good culture there.” - **CJ Hawkins, Software Developer**

You need to hire your first developer. Where do you start?

[7 Generation Capital](https://www.7gen.com/)  CEO Frans was building his business and was at a point where he needed to hire his first developer whose contributions would shape the software development of 7 Generation Capital for years to come. Not an easy feat.  
 
Frans said, “I was looking for someone well-rounded who has a bit of experience doing everything. We were also specifically looking for someone with backend experience around APIs, because we thought that would be an important part of our business. We also needed someone who was willing to roll up their sleeves and do whatever it takes. Your first engineer has to wear many hats: doing their own DevOps, making decisions about infrastructure for the rest of the team, and tackling those typical challenges that come up in a startup environment. So we were looking for someone self-starting with broad experience.”  

🔧 Commit helped Frans launch faster by completing our due diligence to find the right software developer and giving them a chance to work with 7 Generation Capital for 3 months before having them sign on full-time.

Frans told us, “...you sort of get to ‘date’ before you get ‘married.’ This is especially valuable when you’re trying to hire a talented engineer, because many good engineers already have a steady job—enticing them away into a riskier startup role can be tricky. The engineers at Commit know what they’re getting into and Commit helps de-risk that process, which makes it easier for everyone involved.”  
  
✅ He hired his first developer and hired a CTO through Commit 6 months ago.

 “It’s early stage, so the company is very fresh. There’s a lot to sort out. It was a big learning process, technically and not technically, from time management to figuring out what to do, how to do it best, what needs to be prioritized. There are a lot of things that need to happen, so it’s been stressful at times, but it’s also exciting when things come together. And the team is excellent. They’re all amazing, everyone is very supportive. I have nothing but good things to say about them.” - **Andrew Lukonin, Senior Software Developer**

“With 7Gen I had to make some risky decisions during my pilot. Having this kind of safety network helped me to make good decisions so 7Gen is happy to be with me. Talking with Beier and Greg, having access to the select channels, seeing questions that people posted there that applied to me, I learn every day. Commit made it possible, and it was the most important experience in my career.” - **Fabio Mirando, CTO**
