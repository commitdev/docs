### Why is there an annual 10% placement fee?

We‚Äôve spent the past few months testing pricing, and what we‚Äôre finding founders really love is 10% of the starting salary for a max of 3 years. It aligns all of our interests in making the right matches, it eases cash flow for you versus an upfront lump sum, and it‚Äôs a better representation of the value access to the Commit community provides.

You can think of Commit as an API for great developers - working with Commit lets you scale up and scale down as needed. You don't end up paying astronomical fees for developers who don't stick around. If they end up being long-term employees, paying more than you would ordinarily pay a recruiter isn't an issue. If for whatever reason they don't work out, you aren't out of pocket or on the hook for a bunch of cash that is connected to a resource that isn't adding value.

### How does Commit set their salary bands?

At Commit, we have salaries that are based on the candidate's seniority, location-agnostic. All of our salary bands are aligned with industry average salaries.

### Why do developers join Commit?

Developers join Commit because we de-risk their job transition process; every developer we hire wants to move into a full-time role at a startup, and appreciates Commit's support in vetting startups. You can read more about our value to developers [here](https://blog.commit.dev/articles/the-career-gap-for-entrepreneurial-engineers).

Additionally we are building the world‚Äôs most collaborative technical community where developers get access to fellow developers to solve problems faster and grow as leaders. The [community](https://app.commit.dev/login) is currently invite-only!

To learn even more about what developers think of Commit, read a few of our testimonials:

### How does Commit find and vet developers?

Commit finds developers via three routes:

1.  24% Network - Nominations from existing community members who‚Äôve shipped code alongside them and general word of mouth recommendations.
    
2.  36% Outbound - Email outreach and door knocking‚Äô via LinkedIn. We‚Äôve built an algorithm that calculates FIT score on LinkedIn and we only reach out to developers who have a FIT score of 90 or higher.
    
3.  40% Inbound - Job boards and social media where we communicate our offering.
    

Out of the total applicants we receive, we hire approximately 1 out of every 200 or 0.5% of applicants.

### To gain a better understanding of how we vet developers, please review our [interview process documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vpUrPyYLrRB3bmWwPNZcDrdkAH7sVGBCHpAbXnCo-qY/edit?usp=sharing).  
  

### What type of developers does Commit have?

We put a lot of effort and time into finding developers who are both strong programmers but equally strong communicators. We hire both Senior Full Stack Developers and Senior Software Developers. Below is an example of our requirements for a Senior Software Developer.

We look for developers who have the following characteristics:

-   4+ years of experience in software engineering (non-internship)
    
-   Experience working on SaaS, marketplace, consumer or infrastructure
    
-   Entrepreneurial mindset and growth-oriented attitude
    
-   Ambitions of excellence in your craft. Some of our past EPs have grown into CTOs, principal engineers, and/or joined companies as the first engineer
    
Our Preferred Tech Stack for Commit developers is as follows:

-   **FE**: One/some of: Vue.js, React, Redux, Next
    
-   **BE**: One/some of: Node.js, Go/Golang, Python/Django/Flask, Ruby/Rails, Java/Scala, Rust
    
And we have a few nice to haves on top of that:

-   Understanding of DevOps: MongoDB, AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes/Terraform, CI/CD
    
-   Understanding of RESTful APIs and/or GraphQL
    
-   Understanding of cloud-native distributed systems and microservices
    
-   Experience with relational databases, NoSQL databases, cloud infrastructure, product design
    
### How does a Commit developer fit into my existing interview process?

Commit has put our developers through a technical vetting process to save you time and effort. We facilitate 60-minute Zoom conversations with the candidates you want to meet. The focus is to get to know the developer's skill set and experiences, and ensure a good fit for your team. Our developers do not expect a technical component in their interview with you and are not actively going through technical interviews at other organizations.

You can see a full summary of the rules of interviewing Commit developers [here](https://www.notion.so/Commit-s-Guide-to-Interviewing-Commit-Engineers-8d8e9f4441e74137b082d0b140bcb454).

### Can my startup leverage Commit for part-time or contract work?

No. All of Commit's developers are looking to join a startup full-time after the pilot period.

### How does vacation work during the pilot?

We want to help our developers balance between (1) maximizing their time working with and getting to know you and (2) ensuring that they take time to rest and recharge even while on pilot. For this reason, our developers can take 3 days off during their pilot (including statutory holidays), without affecting the amount invoiced by Commit. Any days above the 3-day limit will be deducted accordingly from your invoice covering the period when the excess days off are taken. 

Our developers are advised to provide as much notice as possible to you about their time-off plans, and communicate these plans to the Engineer Success team as well.

Ideally, Commit, the SP, and the EP will all try to align on a time-off plan that is acceptable to all parties. 

### What tax benefits can I take advantage of while working with Commit?

#### SRED (üá®üá¶ startups only)

Canadian startups are eligible to claim SRED for the work that a Commit developer does for your company. During the pilot, you can access SRED at the contractor rate, and once they join you full-time, you can claim SRED with them as an employee.

### As an U.S. startup, can I hire from Commit?

#### Corporate Structure (*US startups only)

American startups don't need a Canadian subsidiary to get started with a Commit developer. During the 3-month pilot period, Commit will manage taxes, payroll, and benefits so you can focus on shipping code. We're here to help advise you on when it's time to create a Canadian subsidiary, how to go about setting one up, and how to employ Canadians until a subsidiary makes sense. Corporate structure is never a blocker to bringing a Commit developer onboard for a pilot, or full-time.

### What support does Commit offer me and the Commit developer during the pilot period?

Our multi-talented team is always happy to help and we continue to support all Commit developers and Startup Partners (SPs) in our ecosystem.

 *Startup Partners*

-   **Check-ins**: At the 1-week, 1-month, and 2-month mark of the pilot we‚Äôll be asking you what‚Äôs been going well and what has not been working well.
    
-   **Upskilling**: You may have told us that the developer needs to improve their React skills. We will have a conversation with them and pair them with a mentor to improve in this area.
    
-   **Networking**: Commit has a supportive community of tech leaders, founders, and our own legal and finance team to grow your network and ask for help.

*Commit Developers*

-   **Check-ins**: At the 1-week, 1-month, and 2-month mark of the pilot we‚Äôll be asking you what‚Äôs been going well and what has not been working well.
    
-   **Technical Support**: Access to our developer community and tools to WOL and solve technical problems faster.
    
-   **Networking**: Commit has built an invite-only community of remote-first startup developers to better communicate and collaborate on meaningful projects.


### What is the process for bringing on a developer full-time after the 3-month pilot?
  
Hiring a Commit developer after the 3-month pilot is straightforward.  
  
Simply follow your own internal hiring processes and prepare an offer to the developer 3-4 weeks prior to the end date of the pilot.

At Commit, we actively take steps to reduce gender pay gaps when hiring all of our employees (including our engineers). We approach the negotiation conversation making our best offer, first. We want the offer experience to be positive and encourage all our employees to bring their authentic selves to the conversation.

Compensation for all our startup partners looks different and can pull on different levers and sweeteners (equity, vacation time, remote work perks etc). Taking this into account - developers at Commit are educated on salary bands when hired. We want our developers to feel empowered going into negotiation conversations feeling valued and that they‚Äôve found a long term fit that they will be making an impact and compensated fairly for their work.

If you have any questions or need help deciding on what to offer, feel free to reach out to our Engineer Success team who you would have already been in touch with throughout the pilot.

### How do I stay up to date on changes within the Commit ecosystem?

[Subscribe](https://share.hsforms.com/1raH_qJLYTdmEcXnJaOI3UAc2co1) to our Startup Partner (SP) newsletter to stay up to date on our latest upgrades to the program, new additional offerings and celebrate wins within our SP community.

### How does Commit determine a Senior versus a Junior developer?

Please see our [Engineering Competency Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/131XZCEb8LoXqy79WWrhCX4sBnGhCM1nAIz4feFZJsEo/edit#gid=0) which explains how we classify our developers and their seniority.


### What if I need to extend the 3-month pilot?

This would be something that we are happy to discuss on a case by case basis. We‚Äôve had a few Startup Partners extend a pilot by a week or two when more time was unexpectedly needed for administrative things, such as preparing an offer or setting up onboarding.

We have also had pilots extended in the rare cases when the Startup Partner and/or the Commit developer need more time to determine if there is a long-term fit. We have regular check-ins at the 1- and 2-month mark where this would need to be communicated and agreed upon between the Startup, Commit, and the developer.

### What if I want to hire a Commit developer before the 3-month pilot ends?
We want to acknowledge (and share) your excitement and confidence around bringing on a Commit developer full-time before a pilot has ended. It is our ultimate goal to find a great long term fit for our Startup Partners and developers!

The 3-month pilot timeline is designed to give enough time for the developer to get a good understanding of the culture, company, and technology of the startup and have all the information to make an informed decision on their career. This is why we don‚Äôt offer the option to end a pilot early.

If it‚Äôs been mutually agreed for a Commit developer to join your startup full-time, there are steps that can be taken early on in the pilot to enable a seamless transition. For example, you can prepare an offer for the developer to be able to discuss compensation and specific requirements for joining full-time, rather than waiting for the 2-month mark in the pilot (when we would usually encourage this step).

### What do Commit developers expect to get paid after graduation?

All of our developers are aligned with the industry average. After the 3-month pilot period, if the developer is to graduate to the startup (join you full time) - it would be between you and the developer to negotiate a salary within this range. All of our startups do indeed have different compensation packages that include equity. Other "sweeteners" our Startup Partners choose to offer include health benefits, unlimited PTO, Learning & Growth fund, etc.

### Are there any hidden costs?

No. We value transparency and therefore share our costs upfront. There is no cost to matchmaking and no obligations to hire through Commit. You will only get charged: (1) during a pilot, and (2) if a graduation occurs.

The costs are as follows:

-   **Pilot fees** - C$12k to C$14.6k per month
    
-   **Placement fees** - annual 10% capped at 3 years or one-time 25%
    
### What taxes are applicable to me as a US entity?

Commit does not currently charge taxes on fees charged to US entities.

### What is in Commit‚Äôs terms & conditions in regards to IP?

The IP language is usually the most important to our Startup Partners - just like if you hired a dev shop, 100% of the IP created is yours. There are lots of ways to word IP provisions, and all lawyers have preferences here, but our business would not work if there was any risk to your own company / IP. If your lawyers will be reviewing, let them know that these terms have been used with all of our Startup Partners, including larger scale-ups with Series C (or later) funding or who are listed on a stock exchange.

In principle, anything that a Commit developer does for the SP belongs to SP only. In practice, almost everything that the Commit developer does while on pilot will fall under "Deliverables", which will be owned by the SP exclusively. There are rare occasions where a Commit developer may develop a separate tool/method and they didn't use any confidential info or IP of SP to develop that tool - this would be theirs to use and reuse in the future as "Commit IP".

The Commit IP consideration ends once the developer is your employee - it only applies while the developer is on pilot and still Commit‚Äôs employee. Once the developer has transitioned to your payroll and is no longer our employee, they would not be considered to be part of Commit or doing anything on behalf of Commit (and so the "Commit IP" provision wouldn't apply).

### If after I place an engineer, it isn‚Äôt working out from either side, what is the process for winding down? I see a standard 2 week notification for termination, is that all there is to it?

After a Commit developer is placed at your organization (graduated) they would have transitioned to your HR/payroll and any termination would be in accordance with your company processes.

If during the 3-month pilot, you decide for any reason you would like to wind down, the 2 week notification would apply.
