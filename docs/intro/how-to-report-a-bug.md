At Commit we encourage engineers to report any bugs or issues that they find with our Platform, these Commit Docs, or really anything else. We recognize the value of having a community of engineers that are able to report these bugs to help better both our product and the work our team is doing. 

## How to report an issue or bug on the Commit platform

Report a bug directly in our platform by using the 'Give Feedback' button in the upper-right hand corner of your screen or by using [this form](https://4xbxmmanuuz.typeform.com/to/zRepfzF6).

The goal of reaching out is to inform our platform team to be able to take immediate action and resolve the issue as quickly as possible!
