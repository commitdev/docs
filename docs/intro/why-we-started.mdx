## Commit is built by Engineers, for Engineers

### Beier Cai, CTO

![Beier](./BeierCaiHeadshot.png)

ðŸ‘‹ I'm Beier, CTO and co-founder at Commit.

Iâ€™ve been a software engineer for 16 years. Iâ€™ve spent my career working at startups - I was the first engineer at Hootsuite and helped scaling the team to over 1000 employees.

As my job shifted to management, I learned that I'm really passionate about helping engineers learn and grow.

I built Commit to fix the career gap that I faced as a Startup Engineer.
