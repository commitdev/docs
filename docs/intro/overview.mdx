Hey 👋       We’re Commit, the network for the most collaborative remote startup developers.

We use data to connect developers together to solve problems faster in three key areas:  

-   Peer Support - Intelligent Peer Support connects you to experts to get unstuck, gather opinions, and solve problems faster.
    
-   Learning & Development - Personalized L&D helps you learn faster with other developers.
    
-   Career Transitions - Seamless Career Transitions helps you skip to the final interview and connect directly to vetted hiring managers that want to build with you.
    
To get started, learn more about why we do it and read stories from developers we’ve helped:
-   [Key Operating Principle](https://docs.commit.dev/about/key-operating-principle): Do what’s best for the developer
    
-   [Why we started](https://docs.commit.dev/about/why-we-started)
    
-   [Testimonial from Clara, Software Engineer at Procurify](https://commit.dev/2020/03/25/committed-to-success-clara-tsang-software-engineer-at-procurify/)
    
-   [Testimonial from Andrew, Software Lead at 7 Generation Capital](https://commit.dev/2021/10/14/committed-to-success-andrew-lukonin/)
    
These docs were written for you to get more comfortable with Commit, gain guidance on your upcoming journey with Commit, and challenge the way we approach work.

As we continue to learn and work out loud, these docs will be updated. Bear with us if they are not always perfect - in fact let us know, we’re always looking to improve and value your input.

Commit is a kind, collaborative place for team members to grow together and we are lucky to learn and grow with you!
