## Community Guidelines

Commit is currently in closed beta and we are learning a lot each day! As we open up to a broader audience, we expect this page to evolve! If you have any feedback and suggestions, we would love to hear from you.

### Principles that make the Commit community a special place

The Commit community was designed to provide the software development community a safe place to build long term relationships (to both ask questions and celebrate the small wins) throughout your career.

- **Be yourself**: Authenticity is the backbone of Commit, from our go to market strategy to our community, and that starts with you!
- **Work Out Loud**: This is one of the core operating principles that prop up the community here at Commit. We operate in an open culture of asking for help and helping others in return. If you have questions, it is likely others have the same questions or can help with yours.
- **Be Respectful**: This applies to every person, at all times, regardless of what stage of the EP journey you are at.
- **Be Inclusive**: At Commit we believe there is tremendous value in diversity. We all come from different backgrounds that only add value when we come together as a community.

### Maintaining Commit Authenticity

Commit is a community of talented startup developers committed to collaborating in order to accelerate personal growth.

By design, this is a place to go when you need to "get unstuck" on one of the many tricky problems you will encounter as an early stage tech lead.

To help keep this an effective place for peer-to-peer collaboration, we ask that you refrain from posting job opportunities. If there is an opportunity that you think your fellow community members could benefit from, please reach out to startups@commit.dev!

## Social Media Policy

üí¨ Be respectful. Be kind. Be Clear.

Commit is a company built around our brand. If we have a good brand, others will want to work with us! Make sure you are aware of that in your communications with others online.

Disclose your affiliation when required. If you talk about work-related matters that are within your area of job responsibility, you should ensure that you are accurate, and if relevant, mention that you work with Commit. Note when something is your opinion. If it could be unclear, you should make sure to state that the views expressed are your own. While something like ‚ÄúI love chocolate ice cream‚Äù is not likely to be mistaken as a company opinion, something like ‚ÄúGCP is the worst cloud provider‚Äù might be. Use your judgement, and ask if it‚Äôs unclear.

Act responsibly and ethically. When participating in online conversation, do not misrepresent yourself. Don‚Äôt use company information or resources to conduct anything that would be considered unethical.

**We do not tolerate discrimination** (including age, sex, race, colour, creed, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, citizenship, disability, or marital status or any other legally-recognized protected basis under federal, state, or local laws, regulations or ordinances) or harassment of any kind. Any breach of this is taken very seriously.

Be careful about what personal information you share online. Do not publish, post, or release information that is considered confidential or private. This includes information on clients we work with as well. If you are unsure if something is public or not, ask the person who owns that information, be it a client or our internal team.

## Harassment and Zero Tolerance

Commit does not allow harassment of any kind to or by our community members. Even though we are a remote company there are still many forms of harassment that can happen in the workplace. If you are being harassed (or even feel like you might be) you should bring it up with HR at hr@commit.dev.
<!--
This applies to us working with our startup partners too. If you are experiencing anything with startup partners that are making you feel uneasy, we will do our best to either resolve the issue or move you to another pilot.

If you don‚Äôt feel comfortable bringing it up with them, find another member of the Engineer Success Team that you can talk to about the issue.-->
